[Mech E]
A mechanical engineer is a professional who designs or builds machines to meet human needs. 
Mechanical engineers use creative skills to produce design plans for machines and other types of mechanical devices 
and systems for the marketplace. Throughout the stages of production, they make sure their products are efficient and 
effective, and they create technical plans and drawings to outline their plans for execution.

[Aero E]
An aerospace engineer is a professional who works on mechanical equipment designed to operate in space or air. 
Examples of items they create include aircraft, missiles, satellites and spacecraft. 
Aerospace engineers often become experts in a specific field, such as 
    - aerodynamics, thermodynamics, celestial mechanics, guidance and control systems, 
    - flight mechanics, propulsion and acoustics.
There are two branches of the aerospace engineering field: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. 
Aeronautical engineering specializes in the technology, theory and practice of flights in the air; 
while astronautical engineering focuses on spacecraft.
