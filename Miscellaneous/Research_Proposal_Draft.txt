What do I do? What is my background in? Why should you and the world listen to me?

My background is as an Aerospace Engineer and Physicist

Aerospace engineering is a four-year curriculum that begins with fundamental engineering courses in mechanics, thermodynamics, materials, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer.

Physicists explore the fundamental properties and laws that govern space, time, energy, and matter. They may study theory, design and perform experiments, or apply their knowledge in developing materials or equipment.

BUT NOW I AM A SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHER OF NATURE PHYSICS AND EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS ENGINEERING

Title Idea: "How He Got His Scars: The Physicist Explores the Science of Madness and Mental Health in a Psychiatric-Intstitutional Representaion of Schizophrenia and Abnormal Human Ingenuity."
Hook: We live in a moment of history where change is so speeded up that we begin to see the present only when it is already disapearing.
Proposal: To propose that madness may have a function is not to deny the toll it may exact on people, but to help us understand what problem it is meant to solve. 
Background: R.D. Laing theorised that insanity could be understood as a reaction to the divided self. Instead of arising as a purely medical disease, schizophrenia was thus the result of wrestling with two identities: the identity defined for us by our families and our authentic identity, as we experience ourselves to be. When the two are fundamentally different, it triggers an internal fracturing of the self. The psychiatric and scientific world initially and still view Laing's ideas as radical and it took some distance and time for people to sift through what he was saying and see what might be valuable.
An Immenseley Powerful Idea: If I don't know I don't know, I think I know. If I don't know I know, I think I don't know. 
Thesis: Using Ideation of Entropy, or Chaos Theory of Nonlinear Systems, from Thermodynamic Principals to Model Dynamics of Social-Behavioral Systems To Study Schizophrenia and Other Neurological Abnormalities, Morphologies, or Ingenuity of the Human Brain. 
Observation: While deeply institutionalized narratives concerning psychiatrics of mental illness are highly misunderstood, this may be attributed to the fact that R.D. Laing's Development of His Existential Perspective was highly controversial. That is this not the kind that is done very much as it is in-depth, nitty-gritty, personal, small-scale and interpretive."
Intellectual Opportunity: The notion is upheld that Madness need not all be breakdown. It may also be a break-through. It is potential liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and existential death; R.D. argued that Labels associated with Madness are only a social fact and the social fact of a political event. 
Scientific Method: In this study, A Fundamental Method of Studying Neurobiological Abnormal Dysfunctions and/or Abnormal Functions/Morphologies of The Schizophrenic Brain is employed.
Speculation: In order to understand correlations and causality of the active phase-matter in Schizophrenic traits often included in other neurobiological, neurodevelopmental, or psychiatric disorders.
Motivation: The studies are very interesting but mainstream psychiatry nor the global scientific community has understood what to do with the grand discoveries of nuerosciences, global public health, and social sciences.
Objective: The objective is to research and develop a scientific method with scientific instrumentation in order to provide foundational evidence to inform a clinical social explanation of schizophrenia and Schizophrenic-related traits.
Social Impact: This is a signigicant paradigm to be based on biomedical-analytical, logical-mathematical scientific theory to enable elegant delivery of informatics towards advancing Public Global Health.
Message and Call To Action: We have to find a way of engaging in a truthful dialogue; in a language without knots and entanglements; and the wee, the wee barbs of hatred; and spite and revenge and jealousy; and malice and envy that,; that creep into our mouths and hide in our words.

# Describe an Interesting Biologial or Biomedical Problem 


Schizophrenia captivates me due to its profound impact on individuals and society. This complex mental disorder disrupts perception, thinking, and behavior, affecting millions worldwide. Understanding and addressing schizophrenia have far-reaching scientific, technological, and societal implications.

Scientifically, unraveling schizophrenia involves studying the intricate interplay between genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors. This multidisciplinary approach combines genetics, neuroscience, psychology, and computational modeling. By investigating underlying mechanisms, we can gain insights into its origins and develop improved diagnostic tools and treatments.

Technological advancements, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), provide valuable insights into the brain abnormalities associated with schizophrenia. These imaging techniques visualize structural and functional changes, aiding in the identification of biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.

The societal impact of schizophrenia is significant. Individuals with schizophrenia face personal and professional challenges, while their families and communities provide support and care. Understanding the biological underpinnings can lead to targeted interventions and support systems, improving quality of life and reducing stigma.

My skills in statistical methods, computational fluid dynamics, signals and systems, and deep learning equip me with a strong foundation in data analysis and modeling. While not directly related to schizophrenia research, these skills demonstrate my ability to apply rigorous analytical techniques to complex problems. This proficiency will be invaluable in studying the intricate biological and genetic factors involved.

Moreover, my prior research projects, such as the MEMS Shear Sensor and Flow Separation Theory, funded by DARPA, have honed my ability to work collaboratively and manage research tasks effectively. These experiences have instilled in me the importance of attention to detail and contributing to overall research goals, even in seemingly mundane tasks.

In my personal statement, I emphasized my commitment to mentorship and knowledge sharing. Collaboration and interdisciplinary information dissemination are crucial in addressing complex problems like schizophrenia. I aspire to contribute not only to scientific understanding but also to the mentorship and support of individuals affected by this disorder.

In conclusion, schizophrenia presents a fascinating and challenging opportunity for scientific exploration and societal impact. My experience in data analysis, research collaboration, and commitment to mentorship aligns with the skills necessary to contribute meaningfully to this field. I am eager to delve into the complexities of schizophrenia research, working towards a better understanding and improving the lives of those affected.





[Format Drafting a Personal Statement]
Add a hook
A “hook” is an interesting or eye-catching statement, anecdote, fact, or question placed at the beginning of a piece of writing.

Fellowships are competitive, and individual reviewers may be looking at hundreds of applications at a time. Anything that captures a reader’s attention and makes you stick out in the pile can make a real difference, so include a strong “hook.”

Show creativity
The personal statement is not just a story about your trajectory, but a place to show your creativity. Craft the statement so that the reviewers see you as an individual and not just another applicant in the pile. For example, you can start with a story of how you became interested in science (avoiding clichés, of course) or give an example of an obstacle you had to overcome.

Share your personal experience & goals
Synthesize several of the following in your statement. Choose your topics based based on their relevance to the fellowship’s goals, your research, and your career path:

Your life experience
Your personal history
Your family background
The education and cultural opportunities (or lack of, if there is a desire to learn more) to which you have been exposed
Major influences to your intellectual development
Your career goals
How you plan to use the skills you will develop while supported by the fellowship
Every word counts, and how the statement is organized and how you use the limited space is often part of the review criteria.

Reference the fellowship’s mission
If the fellowship is looking for applicants that can achieve stated goals or live by certain ideals, address these in the personal statement. For example, the NSF GRFP’s two-part criteria states that their applicants and their research are of intellectual merit and will make a broader impact on society.

Tie it all together
A fellowship application is not a collection of individual documents. It is an application package, so everything should be tied together.

The personal statement should demonstrate that you are organized, strategic, and have a clear thought process, showing that you are qualified to carry out the work in your research proposal.
