Title Idea: "How He Got His Scars: The Physicist Explores the Science of Madness and Mental Health in a Psychiatric-Intstitutional Representaion of Schizophrenia and Abnormal Human Ingenuity."
Hook: We live in a moment of history where change is so speeded up that we begin to see the present only when it is already disapearing.
Proposal: To propose that madness may have a function is not to deny the toll it may exact on people, but to help us understand what problem it is meant to solve. 
Background: R.D. Laing theorised that insanity could be understood as a reaction to the divided self. Instead of arising as a purely medical disease, schizophrenia was thus the result of wrestling with two identities: the identity defined for us by our families and our authentic identity, as we experience ourselves to be. When the two are fundamentally different, it triggers an internal fracturing of the self. The psychiatric and scientific world initially and still view Laing's ideas as radical and it took some distance and time for people to sift through what he was saying and see what might be valuable.
An Immenseley Powerful Idea: If I don't know I don't know, I think I know. If I don't know I know, I think I don't know. 
Thesis: Using Ideation of Entropy, or Chaos Theory of Nonlinear Systems, from Thermodynamic Principals to Model Dynamics of Social-Behavioral Systems To Study Schizophrenia and Other Neurological Abnormalities, Morphologies, or Ingenuity of the Human Brain. 
Observation: While deeply institutionalized narratives concerning psychiatrics of mental illness are highly misunderstood, this may be attributed to the fact that R.D. Laing's Development of His Existential Perspective was highly controversial. That is this not the kind that is done very much as it is in-depth, nitty-gritty, personal, small-scale and interpretive."
Intellectual Opportunity: The notion is upheld that Madness need not all be breakdown. It may also be a break-through. It is potential liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and existential death; R.D. argued that Labels associated with Madness are only a social fact and the social fact of a political event. 
Scientific Method: In this study, A Fundamental Method of Studying Neurobiological Abnormal Dysfunctions and/or Abnormal Functions/Morphologies of The Schizophrenic Brain is employed.
Speculation: In order to understand correlations and causality of the active phase-matter in Schizophrenic traits often included in other neurobiological, neurodevelopmental, or psychiatric disorders.
Motivation: The studies are very interesting but mainstream psychiatry nor the global scientific community has understood what to do with the grand discoveries of nuerosciences, global public health, and social sciences.
Objective: The objective is to research and develop a scientific method with scientific instrumentation in order to provide foundational evidence to inform a clinical social explanation of schizophrenia and Schizophrenic-related traits.
Social Impact: This is a signigicant paradigm to be based on biomedical-analytical, logical-mathematical scientific theory to enable elegant delivery of informatics towards advancing Public Global Health.
Message and Call To Action: We have to find a way of engaging in a truthful dialogue; in a language without knots and entanglements; and the wee, the wee barbs of hatred; and spite and revenge and jealousy; and malice and envy that,; that creep into our mouths and hide in our words.

Title Idea 1: "Mad-By-Design: Unraveling the Science of Schizophrenia and the Power of Human Ingenuity"
Title Idea 2: "How He Got His Scars: Unraveling Madness to Explore Schizophrenia and Human Ingenuity through a Psychiatric Institution"

Abstract:
In today's rapidly changing world, we often struggle to understand the present before it becomes the past. This proposal aims to shed light on the function of madness, not to undermine its toll on individuals, but to unravel the problem it is meant to solve. Building upon R.D. Laing's revolutionary theory that schizophrenia arises from the battle between our imposed identity and our authentic self, this research explores the possibility of madness as a breakthrough rather than a breakdown. By applying the concepts of entropy and chaos theory to model the dynamics of social-behavioral systems, we aim to study schizophrenia and other neurological abnormalities, morphologies, and ingenuity of the human brain.

Despite the initial controversy surrounding Laing's existential perspective, there is immense value in delving into the personal, interpretive, and small-scale aspects often overlooked in traditional psychiatric narratives. We propose utilizing a fundamental method of studying neurobiological dysfunctions and abnormal functions/morphologies of the schizophrenic brain. This will help uncover correlations and causalities between the active phase-matter in schizophrenic traits and other related disorders.

The motivation behind this study stems from the world's failure to effectively utilize the groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, global public health, and social sciences. Through rigorous research and the development of a scientific method backed by advanced instrumentation, our objective is to provide foundational evidence for a clinical social understanding of schizophrenia and its related traits. This paradigm shift, rooted in biomedical-analytical and logical-mathematical scientific theory, will facilitate the advancement of global public health.

To achieve meaningful impact, we must engage in a truthful dialogue free from knots of hatred, revenge, jealousy, and malice that taint our words. By exploring the history of indigenous and Latin American cultures, anthropology-engineering, science and technology, psychiatry and neuroscience systems, and social justice, we can create an open and inclusive platform for transformative research.

In conclusion, our research proposal "How He Got His Scars" aims to uncover the intricate relationship between madness, mental health, and the human brain. By merging scientific methods with social impact, we can pave the way for advancements in both individual well-being and global public health. It is high time we embrace this ancient paradigm of psychiatric thought, combining research and development with a deep understanding of cultural diversity, to drive positive change in society.
