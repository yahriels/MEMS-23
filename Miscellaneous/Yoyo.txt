Brief Essays
In the spaces below, please provide concise (i.e., in approximately 300 words) responses to each of the following questions. *You may use more than the allotted space for your response, and any additional text will be included in your application.
Question 1: Choice of Field and Future Expectations 
How did you choose your field and what are your primary expectations of your future career? If you are currently in your second or later year of graduate school, you should make your case here for why receiving a Fellowship would result in exceptional leverage in the kind and quality of your graduate work, including your ability to pursue promising new ideas. Please understand before continuing this application, that such a case will have to be very strong to be considered further, and that new Hertz Fellowships are very rarely granted to students currently in their second year of graduate study or beyond.
