[NSF-GRFP]
What sets the NSF GRFP apart from other fellowships is the emphasis on two specific review criteria. The first is that the applicant and their research have the potential to advance knowledge and understanding within the field or across different fields (intellectual merit) and that the applicant and their research benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (broader impact). The entire application including the personal statement and the research proposal should touch upon these two criteria.

Along with these two main review criteria, the NSF also is interested in creative, original, or potential transformative concepts; plans that are well-reasoned, well-organized and based on sound rationale; plans that incorporate a mechanism to assess success; applicants that are qualified to conduct the proposed activities; and the existence of adequate resources available for the proposed activities. The NSF funds the student, not the project, and they are looking for future STEM leaders rather than just scientists and engineers. Mainly, the NSF wants to see if you can write a clear and well-thought-out proposal that asks a solid research question.

Below is a list of questions you should ask yourself when preparing your research statement:

Do you touch on the intellectual merit (advancing knowledge) and broader impact (benefit society) of your proposed research? How would answering this research question change science (Intellectual Merit) or society (Broader Impacts)?
Do you have a clear knowledge of what you are proposing (are you comfortable with the topic)?
Do you have a clear research question that you hope to answer?
Do you have a plan that is well-reasoned, well-organized and based on sound rationale? Does the plain include measures of success?
Can you actually carry out the needed research? Do you know how you will accomplish this plan and does your university/ PI have the adequate resources?
Why should the NSF fund you specifically, and not just this research question? What innovation do you specifically bring to the table?
What are your qualifications?
Below is a sample organization for an NSF GRFP research proposal (please also see general information on research proposals). This proposal should be heavy on the intellectual merit criteria, but should still address the broader impact criteria. It should demonstrate why the broader scientific community/ society should care about this research:

Introduce the scientific problem and its impact on society (i.e. address Review Criteria 1 for Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts)
Outline your research plan (Intellectual Merit focused)
Show the major steps that need to be accomplished.
What is the creative part of your approach?
Have you thought of alternatives for hard or crucial steps?
What skills do you have to make this plan successful?
Conclude with the impact this project will have on your field, general science, and society (address Broader Impacts).
Below is a sample personal statement organization (please also see general information on personal statements above):

Hook (~1.25 pages). This is where you tell your unique story of how you became interested in science. It is a great place to mention if you had to overcome any hardships or would be adding to the diversity of the STEM field. Use this section to address the Broader Impacts criteria. Make sure you have a good “hook” that makes you stick out as an individual and shows your passion for the field.
Relevant Background (~1.25 pages). Hopefully you already have research experience, so explain how that experience has prepared you for success in graduate school and beyond. Mainly use this section for Intellectual Merit, but also highlight the Broader Impacts of your research experience.
Future Goals (~0.5 pages). This is where you tie your personal background and scientific background into one cohesive vision for the future. It is a good place to indicate how you plan to make a broader impact on society.

For Initial Contact Emails Use a Skeleton Document and Sample Resume/CV to pique their interest.
    - Include links to github, linkedin, and overview of reason/significance of connection
    - Present opportunity, will & dream, your treasure, immense intellectual leap, confidence/reasoning & idea/plans
    - Request relevant support/services and availability

[Definition of El Gran Varon]:{“El Gran Varón” was initially banned by some radio stations but became a hit anyway
     — it’s considered by many to be one of the most well-known salsas of all time. 
     Songwriter Omar Alfanno explains that the song was actually inspired by a rumor about a real-life friend. 
     Only years later did he realize that his lyrics contained an eerie prophecy.
     The song’s chorus also includes an old saying: 
        - “Palo que nace doblao’, jamás su tronco endereza” 
        / 
        - “Nature cannot be corrected, a tree that grows up crooked cannot ever be straightened.” 
    Today, that phrasing is heard as outdated and even hateful — and indeed, the song has been rejected by some LGBTQ+ listeners. 
    Still, the song resonated with Gabby — she remembers taking solace in the lyrics and in her father’s tender explanation of their meaning.
    When Gabby came out as a teenager, her father Charlie embraced her, and she credits that song: “Simón died alone so I didn’t have to.”}

Don Quixote Famous Quotes
1. "For neither good nor evil can last for ever; and so it follows that as evil has lasted a long time, good must now be close at hand.”
2. “When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical is madness. To surrender dreams — this may be madness. Too much sanity may be madness — and maddest of all: to see life as it is, and not as it should be!”
3. “Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind.”
4. “Thou hast seen nothing yet.”
5. “Virtue is persecuted by the wicked more than it is loved by the good.”
6. “I do not deny that what happened to us is a thing worth laughing at. But it is not worth telling, for not everyone is sufficiently intelligent to be able to see things from the right point of view.”
7. “It is not the responsibility of knights errant to discover whether the afflicted, the enchained and the oppressed whom they encounter on the road are reduced to these circumstances and suffer this distress for their vices, or for their virtues: the knight's sole responsibility is to succour them as people in need, having eyes only for their sufferings, not for their misdeeds.”
8. “There is no book so bad...that it does not have something good in it.”
9. "I have never died all my life"
10. “Translating from one language to another, unless it is from Greek and Latin, the queens of all languages, is like looking at Flemish tapestries from the wrong side, for although the figures are visible, they are covered by threads that obscure them, and cannot be seen with the smoothness and color of the right side.”
11. “The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks, and it always surfaces above lies, as oil floats on water.”
12. “It is one thing to write as poet and another to write as a historian: the poet can recount or sing about things not as they were, but as they should have been, and the historian must write about them not as they should have been, but as they were, without adding or subtracting anything from the truth.”
13. “What is more dangerous than to become a poet? which is, as some say, an incurable and infectious disease.”
14. “Where there's music there can be no evil.”
15. “Don Quixote is so crazy that he is sure no author could have invented him.”
