About the Fellowship
FANNIE AND JOHN HERTZ FOUNDATION
Tomorrow’s problems cannot be solved with today’s thinking. Guided by this belief, the Fannie and John Hertz Foundation identifies the nation’s most promising innovators in science and technology, and empowers them to pursue solutions to the world’s toughest challenges.
OBJECTIVES 
The late John and Fannie Hertz, in establishing the Fannie and John Hertz Foundation, had as principal objectives the promotion of education and the democratic principles of our nation. This is in support of the economic well-being, security, and enhancement of the scientific and technical leadership of the United States.
GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM 
Since 1963, the Foundation has advanced this objective by providing graduate fellowships to the most promising students pursuing PhD degrees in the physical and biological sciences, mathematics and engineering. In so doing, the Foundation aims to have an outsized impact on innovation in these fields, supporting these future leaders in their pursuit of scientific and technological discoveries, leadership in academic research and education, and crucial scientific contributions in support of the well-being of the United States, and humanity, in general.
The Foundation's goal for this Fellowship is that it will inspire recipients to exercise intellectual independence early in their graduate careers, rather than having to accept immediate assignment to research tasks which may not always correspond to their primary interests. 
The Foundation's resources are overmatched by the large number of outstanding applicants for Fellowships annually. As a result, there is a rigorous screening procedure, including two rounds of technical interviews, to select the most creative and innovative applicants to become Fellows. 
Approximately 12 new Fellowships are awarded each year, renewable annually for a total of five years of support.
}
The Application Review Process:
{
Panelists evaluating 
applications may consider the following with respect to the Intellectual Merit Criterion: the potential of the applicant to advance knowledge based on a holistic analysis of the complete application, including the personal statement, relevant background, future goals, graduate research statement, strength of academic record, description of previous research experience or publication/presentations, and references.
Panelists may consider the following with respect to the Broader Impacts Criterion: the potential of the applicant for future broader impacts as indicated by personal experiences, professional experiences, educational experiences and future plans.
Here is how I like to think of the review criteria, point by point.
How would answering this research question change science (Intellectual Merit) or society (Broader Impacts)?
Why should I fund you specifically, and not just this research question? What innovation do you specifically bring to the table?
Is there a detailed plan? With built in measures of success?
What are your qualifications?
Can you actual carry out the needed research?
At the end of each essay, you should be able to check off how you answered each point above for BOTH Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts.
}
Homework:
{
Read all materials (a few times, without distractions). Prepare a task list with deadlines to perform the Executive Tasks then complete the tasks. Understand how application components and each item requested relate to the review criteria.
}
Proposed Field of Study: 
{
Pursuing STEM field: Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS)
Field of Study 1: DMS: Computational and Date-Enabled Sciences
Field of Study 2: Comp/IS/Eng: Algorithms and Theoretical Foundations
Field of Study 3: Comp/IS/Eng: Scientific Computing
Field of Study 4:  Comp/IS/Eng: Bioinformatics and Bio-inspired Computing
}
Review Criteria Details:
{
WHAT WE LOOK FOR:
Evidence of exceptional creativity, broad understanding of physical principles, and outstanding potential for innovative research is expected. 
Applicants are screened for qualities we believe are essential ingredients of future professional accomplishment and/or leading indicators of future professional success. These include:
Exceptional Intelligence and Creativity with particular emphasis on those aspects pertinent to technical endeavors.
Excellent Technical Education evidenced not only by transcripts and reference reports from senior technical professionals, but also through an in-person, technical interview.
Orientation and Commitment to the applications of the physical sciences as is typical of most applicants.
Extraordinary Accomplishment in technical or related professional studies which may offset slightly lower academic records or add luster to outstanding ones.
High moral and ethical values. 
Leverage demonstration of the difference the award of the Hertz Fellowship is likely to make in the kind, quality, and/or personal creativity of the student's graduate research.
The following conditions apply: 
(1) Only applicants who propose to complete a program of graduate study leading to a PhD degree are eligible. Applications are accepted both from students in the final year of their bachelor’s program and from those who have already commenced graduate study. Please note that applications from students currently beyond their first year of graduate school are only considered favorably in cases where exceptional research leverage can be demonstrated. 
(2) The proposed field of graduate study must be directed toward the understanding and solving of problems associated with contemporary human concern, using applications of knowledge from the physical and biological sciences, mathematics, engineering and computer science. 
(3) Evidence of exceptional creativity, broad understanding of physical principles, and outstanding potential for innovative research is expected. 
(4) Citizenship or Permanent Residency in the United States is required. If you are not a US citizen, we will ask to see proof of Application for Citizenship or your Permanent Resident card when you are interviewed. 
(5) Eligible applicants must also morally commit to make their skills available to the United States in times of national emergency (see Moral Commitment section).
We do not support students pursuing advanced professional degrees other than the PhD, such as enrollees in MD, LLD, public health, veterinary medicine, descriptive biology, nor MBA programs, although we will support the PhD portion of a joint MD/PhD study program. For a list of general fields of study in which Graduate Fellowships are offered by the Foundation, see Fields of Study.
General Review Criteria
Reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:
Intellectual Merit: the potential to advance knowledge
Broader Impacts: the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:
What is the potential for the proposed activity to
Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and
Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?
To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?
Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?
Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?
Extra details on Broader Impacts: 
Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. Intellectual values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the US; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.
Merit Review Criteria specific to the GRFP
Intellectual Merit Criterion: the potential of the applicant to advance knowledge based on a holistic analysis of the complete application, including the Personal, Relevant Background, and Future Goals Statement, Graduate Research Plan Statement, strength of the academic record, description of previous research experience or publication/presentations, and references.
Broader Impacts Criterion: the potential of the applicant for future broader impacts as indicated by personal experiences, professional experiences, educational experiences and future plans.

In so doing, the Foundation aims to have an outsized impact on innovation in these fields, supporting these future leaders in their pursuit of scientific and technological discoveries, leadership in academic research and education, and crucial scientific contributions in support of the well-being of the United States, and humanity, in general.
The Foundation's goal for this Fellowship is that it will inspire recipients to exercise intellectual independence early in their graduate careers, rather than having to accept immediate assignment to research tasks which may not always correspond to their primary interests. 
The Foundation's resources are overmatched by the large number of outstanding applicants for Fellowships annually. As a result, there is a rigorous screening procedure, including two rounds of technical interviews, to select the most creative and innovative applicants to become Fellows. 
Approximately 12 new Fellowships are awarded each year, renewable annually for a total of five years of support.

The Application Review Process:
{
Panelists evaluating 
applications may consider the following with respect to the Intellectual Merit Criterion: the potential of the applicant to advance knowledge based on a holistic analysis of the complete application, including the personal statement, relevant background, future goals, graduate research statement, strength of academic record, description of previous research experience or publication/presentations, and references.
Panelists may consider the following with respect to the Broader Impacts Criterion: the potential of the applicant for future broader impacts as indicated by personal experiences, professional experiences, educational experiences and future plans.
Here is how I like to think of the review criteria, point by point.
How would answering this research question change science (Intellectual Merit) or society (Broader Impacts)?
Why should I fund you specifically, and not just this research question? What innovation do you specifically bring to the table?
Is there a detailed plan? With built in measures of success?
What are your qualifications?
Can you actual carry out the needed research?
At the end of each essay, you should be able to check off how you answered each point above for BOTH Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts.

WHAT WE LOOK FOR:
Evidence of exceptional creativity, broad understanding of physical principles, and outstanding potential for innovative research is expected. 
Applicants are screened for qualities we believe are essential ingredients of future professional accomplishment and/or leading indicators of future professional success. These include:
Exceptional Intelligence and Creativity with particular emphasis on those aspects pertinent to technical endeavors.
Excellent Technical Education evidenced not only by transcripts and reference reports from senior technical professionals, but also through an in-person, technical interview.
Orientation and Commitment to the applications of the physical sciences as is typical of most applicants.
Extraordinary Accomplishment in technical or related professional studies which may offset slightly lower academic records or add luster to outstanding ones.
High moral and ethical values. 
Leverage demonstration of the difference the award of the Hertz Fellowship is likely to make in the kind, quality, and/or personal creativity of the student's graduate research.
The following conditions apply: 
(1) Only applicants who propose to complete a program of graduate study leading to a PhD degree are eligible. Applications are accepted both from students in the final year of their bachelor’s program and from those who have already commenced graduate study. Please note that applications from students currently beyond their first year of graduate school are only considered favorably in cases where exceptional research leverage can be demonstrated. 
(2) The proposed field of graduate study must be directed toward the understanding and solving of problems associated with contemporary human concern, using applications of knowledge from the physical and biological sciences, mathematics, engineering and computer science. 
(3) Evidence of exceptional creativity, broad understanding of physical principles, and outstanding potential for innovative research is expected. 
(4) Citizenship or Permanent Residency in the United States is required. If you are not a US citizen, we will ask to see proof of Application for Citizenship or your Permanent Resident card when you are interviewed. 
(5) Eligible applicants must also morally commit to make their skills available to the United States in times of national emergency (see Moral Commitment section).
We do not support students pursuing advanced professional degrees other than the PhD, such as enrollees in MD, LLD, public health, veterinary medicine, descriptive biology, nor MBA programs, although we will support the PhD portion of a joint MD/PhD study program. For a list of general fields of study in which Graduate Fellowships are offered by the Foundation, see Fields of Study.
General Review Criteria
Reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:
Intellectual Merit: the potential to advance knowledge
Broader Impacts: the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:
What is the potential for the proposed activity to
Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and
Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?
To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?
Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?
Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?
Extra details on Broader Impacts: 
Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. Intellectual values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the US; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.
Merit Review Criteria specific to the GRFP
Intellectual Merit Criterion: the potential of the applicant to advance knowledge based on a holistic analysis of the complete application, including the Personal, Relevant Background, and Future Goals Statement, Graduate Research Plan Statement, strength of the academic record, description of previous research experience or publication/presentations, and references.
