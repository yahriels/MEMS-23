Statement Headline: Unraveling the Neurobiological Landscape of Schizophrenia and Advancing Precision Medicine 
Teaser: This research project takes a multidisciplinary approach, integrating neuroscience, molecular biology, biotechnology systems engineering, and biomedical data science and informatics to explore the complex neurobiological underpinnings of schizophrenia. It aims to bridge knowledge gaps, inform precision medicine, and transform mental health care on a global scale.
Numbers: Data-Driven Insights into Schizophrenia 
Keywords: Data Capture, Neural Dimensions, Neuroimaging, Probabilistic Modeling, Stochastic Phenomena
Our journey into the neurobiological landscape of schizophrenia begins with a commitment to numerical precision. Leveraging state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques, we embark on a comprehensive data capture initiative, gathering neuroanatomical, neurodivergent, and neurophysiological data from diverse populations. This multidimensional dataset captures the nuanced dimensions of schizophrenia, accounting for the stochastic nature of neurobiological phenomena through the employment of probabilistic simulations, particularly Monte Carlo Integration.
This methodology allows us to explore the complex interplay of variables within the neural landscape of schizophrenia, providing an intellectually meritorious approach that represents a novel way of examining this complex disorder. By quantifying the uncertain nature of schizophrenia and using mathematical rigor to analyze large datasets, we strive to uncover concealed patterns and emergent behaviors that define the neurobiology of schizophrenia.
Shapes: Unveiling the Geometric Complexity of Schizophrenia 
Keywords: Fractal Geometry, Recursive Patterns, Neural Topology, Self-similarity, Neurobiological Representations
Schizophrenia, much like the enigmatic Mandelbrot set, exhibits self-similarity across multiple scales. To explore the recursive patterns inherent in neurobiological representations of schizophrenia, we apply fractal geometry. Fractal analysis provides a powerful tool for discerning intricate geometries of neural connectivity and unraveling the nonlinear relationships that define the topological architecture of the schizophrenic brain.
The application of fractal geometry to schizophrenia research adds an intellectually meritorious dimension to our approach, introducing a new perspective to the field. It has the potential to reveal previously undiscovered patterns and structures within the brain, thus advancing our understanding of the disorder's neurobiological basis.

Title: Decoding the Neurobiological Landscape of Schizophrenia: A Multidisciplinary Approach Informed by Numbers, Shapes, and Prediction 
Abstract: Unraveling the complex neurobiological mechanisms of schizophrenia through a multidisciplinary approach that blends data analysis, fractal geometry, and dimensional analysis.
Title: Bleuler's Psychopathological Perspective on Schizophrenia Delusions: Towards New Tools in Psychotherapy Treatment
Abstract: The authors begin by addressing the historical evolution of the delusion concept and its
different approaches, focusing afterwards mainly on the work of Bleuler, who stressed
the proximity between delusions and the emotional life of patients with schizophrenia. I
Therefore, the present work intends to review the main aspects of the theory of delusion
formation in schizophrenia according to Bleuler’s psychopathological perspective. For
that purpose, first the role of delusions in the psychopathology of schizophrenia is
explored in a close relation with the Bleuler’s fundamental symptoms (Alogia, Autism,
Ambivalence, and Affect Blunting) nowadays known as negative symptoms. Then,
persecutory, grandiosity and sexual delusions in schizophrenia are described according
to the tension between logic and affects, as well as, internal conflict, schizoid features,
and auto-erotism as key psychopathological pathways. Thus, with this subjective
perspective, it is intended to highlight Bleuler’s psychopathological contribution to the
affective and meaningful causality of delusions in schizophrenia. The former might be
useful in the integration with other psychopathological phenomena (hallucinations and
negative symptoms) and new forms of research and therapeutic approaches in this
disorder that are complementary with the contemporary tendencies in psychopathology.
Keywords: affectivity, Bleuler, delusions, schizophrenia, psychopathology
Title: Fractality of sensations and the brain health: the theory linking neurodegenerative disorder with distortion of spatial and temporal scale-invariance and fractal complexity of the visible world
Abstract: The theory that ties normal functioning and pathology of the brain and visual system with
the spatial–temporal structure of the visual and other sensory stimuli is described for the
first time in the present study. The deficit of fractal complexity of environmental influences
can lead to the distortion of fractal complexity in the visual pathways of the brain and
abnormalities of development or aging. The use of fractal light stimuli and fractal stimuli
of other modalities can help to restore the functions of the brain, particularly in the elderly
and in patients with neurodegenerative disorders or amblyopia. Non-linear dynamics
of these physiological processes have a strong base of evidence, which is seen in
the impaired fractal regulation of rhythmic activity in aged and diseased brains. From
birth to old age, we live in a non-linear world, in which objects and processes with
the properties of fractality and non-linearity surround us. Against this background, the
evolution of man took place and all periods of life unfolded. Works of art created by man
may also have fractal properties. The positive influence of music on cognitive functions
is well-known. Insufficiency of sensory experience is believed to play a crucial role in the
pathogenesis of amblyopia and age-dependent diseases. The brain is very plastic in its
early development, and the plasticity decreases throughout life. However, several studies
showed the possibility to reactivate the adult’s neuroplasticity in a variety of ways. We
propose that a non-linear structure of sensory information on many spatial and temporal
scales is crucial to the brain health and fractal regulation of physiological rhythms.
Theoretical substantiation of the author’s theory is presented. Possible applications and
the future research that can experimentally confirm or refute the theoretical concept are
considered.
Keywords: fractal therapy, dynamical chaos, fractality of sensations, reactivation of brain plasticity, treatment
and rehabilitation, aging, neurodegenerative diseases, amblyopia
Title: Emergence of lump-like solitonic waves
in Heimburg–Jackson biomembranes
and nerves fractal model
Abstract: The aim of this study is to extend the soliton propagation model in biomembranes and nerves constructed by Heimburg and Jackson for the case of
fractal dimensions. Our analyses are based on the product-like fractal
measure concept introduced by Li and Ostoja-Starzewski in their attempt
to explore anisotropic fractal elastic media and electromagnetic fields. The
mathematical model presented in the paper is formulated for only a part
of a single nerve cell (an axon). The analytical and numerical envelop soliton
of this equation are reported. The results obtained prove the emergence of
lump-type solitonic waves in nerves and biomembranes. In particular,
these waves decay algebraically to the background wave in space direction.
This scenario is viewed as a particular class of rational localized waves
which are solutions of the integrable Ishimori I equation and the (2 + 1)
Kadomtsev–Petviashvili I equation. The effects of fractal dimensions are
discussed and were found to be significant to some extents.
Title: Anthroengineering: an independent
interdisciplinary field
Abstract: In recent decades, funding agencies, institutes and professional bodies have
recognized the profound benefits of transdisciplinarity in tackling targeted
research questions. However, once questions are answered, the previously
abundant support often dissolves. As such, the long-term benefits of these
transdisciplinary approaches are never fully achieved. Over the last several decades, the integration of anthropology and engineering through inter- and
multidisciplinary work has led to advances in fields such as design, human
evolution and medical technologies. The lack of formal recognition, however,
of this transdisciplinary approach as a unique entity rather than a useful tool
or a subfield makes it difficult for researchers to establish laboratories, secure
permanent jobs, fund long-term research programmes and train students in
this approach. To facilitate the growth and development and witness the
long-term benefits of this approach, we propose the integration of anthropology and engineering be recognized as a new, independent field known as
anthroengineering. We present a working definition for anthroengineering and
examples of how anthroengineering has been used. We discuss the necessity
of recognizing anthroengineering as a unique field and explore potential
novel applications. Finally, we discuss the future of anthroengineering,
highlighting avenues for moving the field forward.

Graduate Research Plan Statement
Headline: Unraveling the Molecular Code of Natural Antidepressants in Grapes
Teaser: In the ever-evolving world of scientific inquiry, certain moments emerge as profound intersections of human ingenuity, scientific inquiry, and the enigmatic wonders of nature. Encapsulated within this project is one such moment. With a central focus on unraveling the molecular code of grapes to find the compounds responsible for its potential natural antidepressant properties, Yahriel Salinas-Reyes aims to foster innovation in treatments for mental health disorders and conditions. Also encompassed in the project is an investigation into the nature of schizophrenia and the complexities of neuroplasticity, in hopes of advancing understanding of the mental illness. The overarching goal is to address the mounting global health crisis presented by mental health disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, which have surged to an unprecedented global health crisis significantly diminishing the quality of life for millions and placing immense pressure on healthcare systems worldwide. At its core, the project is driven by the ambition to conduct a comprehensive molecular analysis of grapes, with a particular emphasis on understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the synthesis of antioxidants. Grapes have garnered scientific interest due to their potential health benefits and their recent recognition as potential natural antidepressants. Yahriel's unique background in aerospace engineering and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) equips him with the precision and expertise required to delve into the microscopic realm of chromosomes and molecules—an essential prerequisite for unveiling the genetic secrets grapes hold.
To fulfill the project's objectives, advanced techniques in molecular biology and biotechnology systems engineering will be employed. The primary goal is to pinpoint the specific compounds within grapes responsible for their potential antidepressant properties, involving their isolation and characterization to illuminate their mechanisms of action within the brain. The aim is to identify practical applications for mental health treatment by comprehending the genetic and molecular foundation of natural antidepressant production in grapes. Concurrently, this research adopts a multifaceted approach to unravel the complexities of schizophrenia, a debilitating and chronic mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and cognitive deficits. At the heart of schizophrenia's enduring enigma are Bleuler's four A's: Alogia, Autism, Ambivalence, and Affect blunting. Extensive research has explored the etiology of schizophrenia, leading to the emergence of three prominent theories: genetic, neurodevelopmental, and neurobiological. Each theory offers a distinct perspective on the origins of this complex disorder, making it challenging to pinpoint a single causative factor. Nonetheless, neurobiological theory has gained prominence due to its comprehensive approach, explaining schizophrenia as a result of abnormal brain dysfunctions or structural anomalies. This theory stands on solid scientific ground, holds promise in guiding treatment strategies, transcends cultural and demographic boundaries, and raises fewer ethical concerns compared to alternative theories. Structural and functional abnormalities in key brain systems (i.e., the prefrontal & medial temporal lobes) play a pivotal role in the manifestation of schizophrenia symptoms that are integral to working memory and declarative memory processes. The disrupted functioning contributes to cognitive impairments and emotional dysregulation in individuals with schizophrenia. In the quest to understand schizophrenia, it is essential to investigate these abnormalities. The proposed research plan acknowledges that understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying natural antidepressants in grapes not only holds the potential to address the crisis of mental health disorders, but it may also pave the way for innovative therapeutic solutions for schizophrenia. Such a multidisciplinary approach underscores the importance of transcending conventional disciplinary boundaries in scientific inquiry. Moreover, the potential impact of this research reaches far beyond the confines of the laboratory; it has the power to transform lives and improve the overall quality of life for millions of individuals who are grappling with the debilitating impact of depression and schizophrenia. Yahriel Salinas-Reyes envisions a future where the genetic and molecular knowledge of grapes, harnessed through cutting-edge biotechnology and molecular biology, leads to novel treatment options and brings the elusive solutions to depression and schizophrenia one step closer.

[Personal, Relevant Background and Future Goals Statement for the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program]
Personal Statement
In the realm of mathematics, the concept of chaos game originally alluded to a method of 
generating fractals—intricate geometrical patterns that seem to symbolize the fractured nature of 
reality itself. The intricate dance of numbers, shapes, and chaos mirrors my own journey through 
life, marked by a tapestry of neurological and neurodevelopmental challenges.
My story is one of resilience, determination, and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and has 
been anything but conventional. From an early age, I grappled with ADHD, PTSD, anxiety, and 
autism. These neurological conditions, instead of being impediments, have become the driving 
force behind my academic pursuits. I realized that within the chaos of my mind, there was an 
unexplored realm of creativity and analytical thinking. However, life had more challenges in 
store. Hearing loss and a speech impediment made communication a daily struggle. But rather 
than let these barriers silence me, I embraced the power of written expression. Writing became 
my voice, a medium through which I could convey my ideas, emotions, and discoveries. As I 
embarked on my academic journey, I encountered a myriad of obstacles that tested my resolve. 
Financial challenges loomed large, threatening to derail my dreams of higher education. Yet, I 
persevered, seeking scholarships and part-time work to support my studies. I also navigated the 
language barrier, as English is not my first language, and adapted to the demands of college life 
in a new world. Physical health issues further complicated matters. Sciatica, a debilitating 
condition, left me bedridden and unable to attend classes. Still, I did not relent. I leveraged 
technology to engage with coursework remotely, demonstrating my unwavering commitment to 
my education. In the midst of these personal challenges, I took on the role of the primary 
caretaker for my mother, who battled severe health issues. This responsibility, while emotionally 
taxing, underscored the importance of resilience and compassion. It reinforced my belief in the 
power of empathy and understanding, qualities I have carried into my academic pursuits. The 
most recent chapter in my life introduced a new set of challenges—adjusting to mental health 
medications and diagnoses. While the journey to stability has been arduous, it has deepened my 
empathy for those facing similar struggles and ignited my interest in the intersection of 
mathematics and mental health. My experiences have shaped my academic journey and my 
aspirations. I am driven by a passion for fractal mathematics, drawn to the beauty of patterns that 
emerge from chaos. I see parallels between the complexity of fractals and the human mind, and I 
am determined to explore these connections. Through these trials, I discovered a profound truth: 
our stories are woven into the tapestry of science and art. We tell stories to make sense of the 
world, to illuminate the unknown, and to connect with others. In Mexico, I hope to immerse 
myself in the rich mathematical heritage of the country, studying under esteemed mentors who 
can help me unlock new dimensions of fractal mathematics. I envision collaborative research 
projects that bridge the gap between mathematics and neurodiversity, shedding light on the 
intricate patterns of the human mind. My story is one of resilience, determination, and an
unshakable belief in the transformative power of education. Amid the chaos of life's challenges, I 
have emerged as a passionate scholar, ready to contribute to the world of mathematics and 
advocate for the value of neurodiversity. I am eager to embark on this journey, where I 
can explore the marvel of the human spirit, using mathematics as my compass to navigate the 
intricate patterns of our world. Together, we will write a new chapter in the wondrous story of 
human ingenuity, science, and nature itself.

Overcoming life's adversities, I learned that barriers can be overcome through resilience, determination, and written expression. I discovered the power of my words, turning them into my voice and means of expression. These experiences have shaped my unwavering commitment to education.
Academic Odyssey: From Aerospace to Neuroscience
My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering. I embarked on a quest to understand the mathematical language underlying the cosmos. This foundation equipped me with the analytical tools necessary for unraveling mysteries in both the vastness of space and the intricacies of microscopic systems. During my undergraduate years, I ventured into the realm of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), a field dedicated to crafting precision miniature devices. This journey honed my skills in meticulous design and innovation.
Schizophrenia: A Scientific Muse
My transition from aerospace engineering to neuroscience marked a pivotal turning point. I recognized the enigma of the human brain and its intricate neural circuits as the ultimate frontier. Schizophrenia emerged as my scientific muse, offering a gateway to explore neuroanatomy, neurodiversity, and psychiatric disorders. Moments of sensory wonder and chaos, even synesthesia, offered insights into the complexity of our world.
A Fusion of Logic and Emotion - I am a scientist with a unique blend of scientific rigor and artistic sensibility. This fusion enables me to approach complex problems from multiple angles, shattering traditional boundaries. My journey, filled with twists and turns, molded me into a scientist, an artist, and a seeker of profound truths. This multidimensional perspective is central to my intellectual merit.
Future Goals: Navigating the Cosmos of Knowledge - One of my foremost aspirations is to pursue a Doctorate of Neuroscience and Biomedical Data Science/Informatics at Stanford University. This educational endeavor aligns seamlessly with my research agenda and my desire to unravel the mysteries of the human brain. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, precision engineering, and a commitment to inclusivity, I aim to contribute to scientific knowledge and address critical societal challenges in the realms of mental health and well-being. My future goals encompass a multifaceted odyssey that spans the realms of academia, societal impact, artistic expression, and the cosmic exploration of the universe.
