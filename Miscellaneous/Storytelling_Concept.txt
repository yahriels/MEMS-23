NEUROSCIENCE IDEA OF RD Laing 

Mad to be Normal - "sane reaction to an insane world"
- Any resemblance to any actual persons is entirely coincidental
- The Kingsley Hall experiments was never conducted again but his ideas are forever
- A scottish psychiatrist whose radical ideas for helping psychotic patients included the therapeutic use of LSD and the creation of Kingsley Hall, a medication-free sanctuary in east London.

{His Theory}Laing theorised that insanity could be understood as a reaction to the divided self. Instead of arising as a purely medical disease, schizophrenia was thus the result of wrestling with two identities: the identity defined for us by our families and our authentic identity, as we experience ourselves to be. When the two are fundamentally different, it triggers an internal fracturing of the self.

Message/Call to Action

....
We have to find a way of
engaging in a truthful dialogue

in a language without
knots and entanglements

and the wee, the
wee barbs of hatred

and spite and
revenge and jealousy

and malice and envy that,

that creep into our mouths
and hide in our words.
....


*OFTEN MISQUOTED & MISINTERPRETED*
MADNESS WAS A SELF HEALING VOYAGE: "to make madness and the process of going mad comprehensible"
A THEORY NOT A FACT
Schizophrenia is defined (neurobiological theory) as a result of abnormal dysfunctions, or abnormal strucutres of the brain.

Schizophrenia cannot be understood without understanding despair

Laing's social explanation of schizophrenia was a result of the interactions between people, especially in families. Bateson er al.(1956) suggested the bind theory, which suggests that children who frequently recieve contradictory messages from their parents are more likely to develop schizophrenia

Existential Perspective: Insanity could be a creative and adaptive response to the world. Ronald David Laing or R.D. developed the theory that mental illness was an escape mechanism that allowed individuals to free themselves from intolerable circumstances.

We are effectively destroying ourselves by violence masquerading as love

Alienation as our present destiny is achieved only by outrageous violence perpetuated by human beings on human beings

We live in a moment of history where change is so speeded up that we begin to see the present only when it is already disapearing.

Insanity - A perfectly rational adjustment to an insane world. 

Freud was a hero. He descended to the Underworld and met there stark terrors. He carried with him his theory as a Medusa's head which turned these terrors to stone

We are all in a post-hypnotic trance induced in early infancy

Children do not give up their innate imagination, curiosity, dreams easily. You have to love them to get them to do that. 

If I don't know I don't know, I think I know. If I don't know I know, I think I don't know. 

Madness need not all be breakdown. It may also be a break-through. It is potential liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and existential death. 

Labels are only a social fact and the social fact of a political event. 

Our family grew up in the "dark ages" of psychiatric treatment and it left its effect on us

"It is not the kind of research that is done very much. It is in-depth, nitty-gritty, personal, small-scale and interpretive." 

"The studies are very interesting but I don't think mainstream psychiatry has understood what to do with them."

the whole philosophy was to discover yourself through losing yourself.

"It took some distance and time for people to sift through what he was saying and see what might be valuable."

El Gran Varon


Yaqui is a Southern Uto-Aztecan language spoken by a people living predominantly in Sonora
Yaqui (or Hiaki), locally known as Yoeme or Yoem Noki, is a Native American language of the Uto-Aztecan family. It is spoken by about 20,000 Yaqui people, in the Mexican state of Sonora and across the border in Arizona in the United States.
{https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/la-brega/articles/el-gran-varon-who-was-simon}
[Definition of El Gran Varon: Letra De La Cancion - La Sonora Tropicana]:{“El Gran Varón” was initially banned by some radio stations but became a hit anyway
     — it’s considered by many to be one of the most well-known salsas of all time. 
     Songwriter Omar Alfanno explains that the song was actually inspired by a rumor about a real-life friend. 
     Only years later did he realize that his lyrics contained an eerie prophecy.
     The song’s chorus also includes an old saying: 
        - “Palo que nace doblao’, jamás su tronco endereza” 
        / 
        - “Nature cannot be corrected, a tree that grows up crooked cannot ever be straightened.” 
        - "Simon died so I wouldn't have to"
    Today, that phrasing is heard as outdated and even hateful — and indeed, the song has been rejected by some LGBTQ+ listeners. 
    Still, the song resonated with Gabby — she remembers taking solace in the lyrics and in her father’s tender explanation of their meaning.
    When Gabby came out as a teenager, her father Charlie embraced her, and she credits that song: “Simón died alone so I didn’t have to.”}

Don Quixote Famous Quotes
1. "For neither good nor evil can last for ever; and so it follows that as evil has lasted a long time, good must now be close at hand.”
2. “When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical is madness. To surrender dreams — this may be madness. Too much sanity may be madness — and maddest of all: to see life as it is, and not as it should be!”
3. “Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind.”
4. “Thou hast seen nothing yet.”
5. “Virtue is persecuted by the wicked more than it is loved by the good.”
6. “I do not deny that what happened to us is a thing worth laughing at. But it is not worth telling, for not everyone is sufficiently intelligent to be able to see things from the right point of view.”
7. “It is not the responsibility of knights errant to discover whether the afflicted, the enchained and the oppressed whom they encounter on the road are reduced to these circumstances and suffer this distress for their vices, or for their virtues: the knight's sole responsibility is to succour them as people in need, having eyes only for their sufferings, not for their misdeeds.”
8. “There is no book so bad...that it does not have something good in it.”
9. "I have never died all my life"
10. “Translating from one language to another, unless it is from Greek and Latin, the queens of all languages, is like looking at Flemish tapestries from the wrong side, for although the figures are visible, they are covered by threads that obscure them, and cannot be seen with the smoothness and color of the right side.”
11. “The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks, and it always surfaces above lies, as oil floats on water.”
12. “It is one thing to write as poet and another to write as a historian: the poet can recount or sing about things not as they were, but as they should have been, and the historian must write about them not as they should have been, but as they were, without adding or subtracting anything from the truth.”
13. “What is more dangerous than to become a poet? which is, as some say, an incurable and infectious disease.”
14. “Where there's music there can be no evil.”
15. “Don Quixote is so crazy that he is sure no author could have invented him.”

WHAT IS THE TEST? --> DOES IT STAND THE TEST OF TIME?

    ---- Conceptual Reasoning/Argument/Motivation for Program Selection ----
    Not really robots I mean I've already done that. But sort of incorporating computers and computation/automation 
    into modern scientific & mathematical theory to apply the engineering process to any kind of scientific problem. 
    Sort of like creating the framework to have a "computer" to perform all the investigative, analytical, 
    and innovative tasks for a given program but in terms of developing scientific theory. 
    Since this is already well established in the engineering and STEM-heavy parts of the world and STEM, there really
    isn't a point in hopping on an already high-speed moving train. 
    But for Neuroscience, Bioinformatics, Social Sciences, _XYZ_ a fundamental/universal interpretive and mathematical framework/structure is lacking
    and there has been no recent or impactful advancements in this relevant area of scientific investigation and mathematical modeling;
    That is the Neuroscience & Social Sciences Fields are trying to operate a train service without any train tracks.
    Here, the "train tracks" represents the understanding which enables the application of fundamental mathematical theory 
    and guiding principals towards advancement in the global scientific community.
    So my thought is that my role would be to build all these research tools I learned to utilize in my degree 
    and with a bottom-up approach apply them to the Global Neuroscience & Social Sciences of high significance
    - inplace of the aerospace/engineering problems I was presented with in my undergraduate degree. 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While these great leaders of the 19th & 20th century: Carnot, Leibniz, Clausius, Boltzmann
    - I highly doubt that they were alone in pursing scientific discovery of that caliber
        - What about the people all around the world that don't recieve recognition? 
        - It doesn't make their findings any less significant, or intriquing/inspirational.
    - What would happen if we were able to capture/rediscover the lost or redacted/obsolete scientific discoveries 
    - and bring them to the forefront of the scientific community?
        - What could we learn? What could we utilize/transform and advance? What could we impact? 
        - Where/How does it end? Does Order/Classification matter? How Far Can We Go (instead of "what're the limitations")?

_____________________________________________________________
    [THEME/OBSERVATION] (9/11/23)

    Soon it was realized that these ideas could do much more than simply explain how _XYZ_ worked.
    Just as Leibniz had suspected with his notion of living force,
        - That these ideas were applicable/capable of a much grander scale
    
    Clausius - Mathematician & Introduced Entropy (2nd Law of Tth)
    
    This idea became known as _XYZ_ and it turned out to be stranger and more beautiful, 
        more universal than anything that _XYZ_ could've imagined. 


    [The Tax of Being Human or Being Able To Think]
    The world is best explored with an open mind
    Not your stereotypical scientist (Boltzmann), more of a temperment associated with a great artist.
        - ruthelessly logical and analytical, yes
            - BUt while working he'd go through periods of intense emotion
                - And these would be followed by terrible depressions.
                    - Which would leave him completely unable to think clearly (or function)

    [The Collateral Beauty]
    He had terrible mental crises and breakdowns
        - In which he really thought that the world was coming apart at the seems
    AND YET...
        - These were also accompanied by some of the most profound insights into the nature of our world.

    [WHAT ELSE]
    Outside of mathematics, _XYZ_ was passionate about music
        - and was captivated by the grand _XYZ_ and dramatic _XYZ_ of _XYZ_
            - and the raw emotion of _XYZ_

    Brilliant Musician/WILDCARD
        - Could lose himself for hours in his favorite _XYZ_ 
            - just as he could lose himself in deep mathematical theories.

    [DEVELOPMENT]
    A scientist coordinately guided by emotions and instincts
        - and also by his belief in the ability of mathematics 
            - to unlock the secrets of nature

    It was these TRAITS that would lead _XYZ_ to become on eof the champions of a shocking and controversial new theory.
        - One that would describe reality at the very smaller scales,
            - far smaller than anything you could see with a naked eye

    [SPECULATION]
    During the _XYZ_ of the _XYZ_
        - a small group of scientists began speculating that 
            - at the smallest scales (nano-meso scale)
                - the universe might operate very differently to our everyday Experiences
    Universe is made of tiny particles in CONSTANT MOTION

    [AN IMMENSLEY POWERFUL IDEA]
    What is the seemingly insermountable problem with this idea/picture
        - HOW COULD _XYZ_, A ..., EVER BE STUDIED?
        - HOW DO WE DESCRIBE ALL OF THIS?
            - AFTERALL, Rule 1, Rule .., Rule n
                - IT SEEMED ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBLE problem
                    - BECAUSE _XYZ_ saw _XYZ_ more clearly than anyone to explain new strata of reality
                        - IT HAD TO 
    BUT AGAIN, _XYZ_ saw there was a way/path.
        - BECAUSE _XYZ_ saw _XYZ_ more clearly than anyone to explain new strata of reality
            - IT HAD TO ABANDON certainty
    INSTEAD OF, trying to _XYZ_ the exact movements of each individual _XYZ_
        - _XYZ_ saw you could build working theories simply by using the probability of certain vector speed 
    _XYZ_ had TRANSPORTED HIMSELF inside _XYZ_ 
        - He imagined a world beneath our everyday reality
            - And found the mathematics to describe it. 
    IT WOULD BE HERE, AT THIS scale
        - That _XYZ_ would one day manage to unlock energy's deepest secret,
            - Despite the widespread hostility for his theories

    [CAUSALITY/REASONING]
    _XYZ_ ideas were highly, highly controversial
        - you have to remember that today we take ... for granted
    BUT THE REASON we take ... for granted is precisely because of Boltzmann's mathematics
        - beacuse it married up so beautifully with experiment. 
    
    [SUMMARY/DISCUSSION] *GO back and write later*
    One of the 
    - HOSTILE CRITISISM
    - WIDER SCIENTIFIC community
    - PEER REVIEW/Climate
    - POSITION/ARGUMENT
        - Not Observable, so not reality (Therefore Obsolete)
        - Labelled _XYZ_ as a fantasist
            - But Boltzmann was right...
    - REVELATION
        - He peered deeper into reality than anyone else had dared
            - And saw that the universe could be from the _XYZ_ hypothesis
                - AND understoood through the mathematics of probability
                    - The FOUNDATION and CERTAINTY of 19th century science were beginning to crumble.
        - REALIZED 
            - As _XYZ_ stared into his Brave New World of _XYZ_
                - He began to realize that his new vision of the universe...
                    - CONTAINED within it an EXPLANATION
                        - TO one of the Biggest Mysteries in Science
        - EXPLANATION
            - He saw that _XYZ_ could reveal IF the RULE N was/were TRUE/FALSE
                - WHY Nature was engaged in an irreversible process
                    - _XYZ_ had the POWER to reveal what entropy really was
                        - And WHy iT must always INCREASE
            - He understood that these ...,you, me, ... are made of much tiner constituents
                - BASICALLY everything we see is an assembly of trillions and trillions of atoms and molecules
                    - AND THIS WAS THE KEY to his INSIGHT about entropy and _XYZ_

    [CLOSING STATEMENT/CONCLUSION]
    HE/_XYZ_ saw/did/worked what _XYZ_ could not
        - THE REAL REASON why a _XYZ_ under _XYZ_ will always perform _XYZ_
    IMAGINE a _XYZ_ of hot mental
        - THE _XYZ_ inside are jostling around
    ENERGY TRANSPORT AT INTERFACE
        - Theory and Model and Hypothesis of NATURAL PROCESS
    OUTOMCE
        - System has gone from STATE 1 to STATE 2 (SPECIAL/META)
            - FINDINGS, observations, properties, numerics, logics, etc.
    SIGNIFICANCE
        - His brilliant mind saw this whole process
            - to be then described mathematically
    CONTRIBUTION
        - HIS great contribution was that
            - although we can talk in rather casual terms...
                - about things getting worse as disorder increases.
        - THE great contribution of _XYZ_ is that he could put numbers/science to it
            - and so he was able to derive a formula 
        - WHICH enables you to calculate the disorder of a System
            - (BOLZTMANN's CONSTANT/EQUATION)
        - IT WILL be his enduring contribution to science
            - so much so, it was ... in ...
        - WHAT THIS equation means in essence
            - IS that there are many more ways
                - FOR things to be messy, disordered, chaotic, etc. (EVENT 1)
                - THAN there are for them to be tidy and ordered (EVENT 2)
        - THAT IS WHY .... things always get messier ...
        - CLOSING STATEMENT
            -Things will move from Order to Disorderly
                - IT IS a LAW that APPLIES TO EVERYTHING from a _XYZ_, to a _ZYX_
            - ALL of THIS IS an explanation/expression of the nature's tendency to move from ORder to Disorderly
            - DISORDER IS THE FATE OF EVERYTHING
