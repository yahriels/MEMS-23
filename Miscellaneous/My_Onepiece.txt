Schizophrenia cannot be understood without understanding despair Laing's social explanation of schizophrenia was a result of the interactions between people, especially in families. Bateson er al.(1956) suggested the bind theory, which suggests that children who frequently recieve contradictory messages from their parents are more likely to develop schizophrenia Existential Perspective: Insanity could be a creative and adaptive response to the world. Ronald David Laing or R.D. developed the theory that mental illness was an escape mechanism that allowed individuals to free themselves from intolerable circumstances. We are effectively destroying ourselves by violence masquerading as love. Alienation as our present destiny is achieved only by outrageous violence perpetuated by human beings on human beings. We live in a moment of history where change is so speeded up that we begin to see the present only when it is already disapearing. Insanity - A perfectly rational adjustment to an insane world.

It is in-depth, nitty-gritty, personal, small-scale and interpretive." [Scientific Proposal] "The studies are very interesting but I don't think mainstream psychiatry has understood what to do with them." the whole philosophy was to discover yourself through losing yourself. "It took some distance and time for people to sift through what he was saying and see what might be valuable." Title Idea: "How He Got His Scars: The Physicist Explores the Science of Madness and Mental Health in a Psychiatric-Intstitutional Representaion of Schizophrenia and Abnormal Human Ingenuity." Hook: We live in a moment of history where change is so speeded up that we begin to see the present only when it is already disapearing. Proposal: To propose that madness may have a function is not to deny the toll it may exact on people, but to help us understand what problem it is meant to solve. Background: R.D. Laing theorised that insanity could be understood as a reaction to the divided self. Instead of arising as a purely medical disease, schizophrenia was thus the result of wrestling with two identities: the identity defined for us by our families and our authentic identity, as we experience ourselves to be. When the two are fundamentally different, it triggers an internal fracturing of the self. The psychiatric and scientific world initially and still view Laing's ideas as radical and it took some distance and time for people to sift through what he was saying and see what might be valuable. An Immenseley Powerful Idea: If I don't know I don't know, I think I know. If I don't know I know, I think I don't know.  Thesis: Using Ideation of Entropy, or Chaos Theory of Nonlinear Systems, from Thermodynamic Principals to Model Dynamics of Social-Behavioral Systems To Study Schizophrenia and Other Neurological Abnormalities, Morphologies, or Ingenuity of the Human Brain.  Observation: While deeply institutionalized narratives concerning psychiatrics of mental illness are highly misunderstood, this may be attributed to the fact that R.D. Laing's Development of His Existential Perspective was highly controversial. That is this not the kind that is done very much as it is in-depth, nitty-gritty, personal, small-scale and interpretive." Intellectual Opportunity: The notion is upheld that Madness need not all be breakdown. It may also be a break-through. It is potential liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and existential death; R.D. argued that Labels associated with Madness are only a social fact and the social fact of a political event.  Scientific Method: In this study, A Fundamental Method of Studying Neurobiological Abnormal Dysfunctions and/or Abnormal Functions/Morphologies of The Schizophrenic Brain is employed. Speculation: In order to understand correlations and causality of the active phase-matter in Schizophrenic traits often included in other neurobiological, neurodevelopmental, or psychiatric disorders. Motivation: The studies are very interesting but mainstream psychiatry nor the global scientific community has understood what to do with the grand discoveries of nuerosciences, global public health, and social sciences. Objective: The objective is to research and develop a scientific method with scientific instrumentation in order to provide foundational evidence to inform a clinical social explanation of schizophrenia and Schizophrenic-related traits. Social Impact: This is a signigicant paradigm to be based on biomedical-analytical, logical-mathematical scientific theory to enable elegant delivery of informatics towards advancing Public Global Health. Message and Call To Action: We have to find a way of engaging in a truthful dialogue; in a language without knots and entanglements; and the wee, the wee barbs of hatred; and spite and revenge and jealousy; and malice and envy that,; that creep into our mouths and hide in our words. Keywords: Mad-By-Design: An Ancient Paradigm of Psychiatric Thought; Research and Development, History of Indigenous and Latin American Cultures, Anthropology-Engineering, Science and Technology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience Systems, and Social Justice and Global Impact Synopsis: This new interdisciplinary field captures the essence of the Human Ingenuity, focusing on the exploration of schizophrenia and the idea that madness may serve a function rather than being solely detrimental. The title also highlights the intersection of psychiatric thought, neuroscience, and social justice, emphasizing the potential global impact of this research. By using captivating and thought-provoking language, the scientific story aims to engage readers and spark their curiosity. Title Idea 2: "How He Got His Scars: Unraveling Madness to Explore Schizophrenia and Human Ingenuity through a Psychiatric Institution" Abstract: In today's rapidly changing world, we often struggle to understand the present before it becomes the past. This proposal aims to shed light on the function of madness, not to undermine its toll on individuals, but to unravel the problem it is meant to solve. Building upon R.D. Laing's revolutionary theory that schizophrenia arises from the battle between our imposed identity and our authentic self, this research explores the possibility of madness as a breakthrough rather than a breakdown. By applying the concepts of entropy and chaos theory to model the dynamics of social-behavioral systems, we aim to study schizophrenia and other neurological abnormalities, morphologies, and ingenuity of the human brain. Despite the initial controversy surrounding Laing's existential perspective, there is immense value in delving into the personal, interpretive, and small-scale aspects often overlooked in traditional psychiatric narratives. We propose utilizing a fundamental method of studying neurobiological dysfunctions and abnormal functions/morphologies of the schizophrenic brain. This will help uncover correlations and causalities between the active phase-matter in schizophrenic traits and other related disorders. The motivation behind this study stems from the world's failure to effectively utilize the groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, global public health, and social sciences. Through rigorous research and the development of a scientific method backed by advanced instrumentation, our objective is to provide foundational evidence for a clinical social understanding of schizophrenia and its related traits. This paradigm shift, rooted in biomedical-analytical and logical-mathematical scientific theory, will facilitate the advancement of global public health. To achieve meaningful impact, we must engage in a truthful dialogue free from knots of hatred, revenge, jealousy, and malice that taint our words. By exploring the history of indigenous and Latin American cultures, anthropology-engineering, science and technology, psychiatry and neuroscience systems, and social justice, we can create an open and inclusive platform for transformative research. In conclusion, our research proposal "How He Got His Scars" aims to uncover the intricate relationship between madness, mental health, and the human brain. By merging scientific methods with social impact, we can pave the way for advancements in both individual well-being and global public health. It is high time we embrace this ancient paradigm of psychiatric thought, combining research and development with a deep understanding of cultural diversity, to drive positive change in society.

Fractals Geometry in Neuroscience - Fractal geometry is a mathematical model that offers a universal language for the quantitative description of neurons and glial cells as well as the brain as a whole, with its complex three-dimensional structure, in all its physiopathological spectrums. - The brain is a complex system with various structures that exhibit a fractal property. It is interesting to note that, probably as an effect of similar governing principles presenting themselves at different scales of the neuronal network, electrical activity with a time course presenting fractal properties arises. Sample-Title: Fractals in the Neurosciences, Part I: General Principles and Basic Neurosciences Sample Abstract: The natural complexity of the brain, its hierarchical structure, and the sophisticated topological architecture of the neurons organized in micro networks and macro networks are all factors contributing to the limits of the application of Euclidean geometry and linear dynamics to the neurosciences. The introduction of fractal geometry for the quantitative analysis and description of the geometric complexity of natural systems has been a major paradigm shift in the last decades. Nowadays, modern neurosciences admit the prevalence of fractal properties such as self-similarity in the brain at various levels of observation, from the microscale to the macroscale, in molecular, anatomic, functional, and pathological perspectives. Fractal geometry is a mathematical model that offers a universal language for the quantitative description of neurons and glial cells as well as the brain as a whole, with its complex three-dimensional structure, in all its physiopathological spectrums. For a holistic view of fractal geometry of the brain, we review here the basic concepts of fractal analysis and its main applications to the basic neurosciences. Keywords: brain; complexity; fractal analysis; fractal geometry; microglia; neuroanatomy; neuron; neurosciences PREDICTION: It turns out that much of the world is chaotic, making it almost impossible to predict - But that doesn't stop us from trying - Knowing whether the sun is going to shine or the heavens are going to open is a global obsession -- But trying to plan our lives around the vagaries of the weather seems almost futile. - Even thought we have precise equations that can describe how clashing air masses interact to create clouds, wind, and rainfall -- it doesn't really help us very much with our Predictions - That's because we can never know the exact speed of every air particle, the precise temperature at every point in space, or the pressure across the whole planet -- And just a small variation of any of these can produce a vastly different forecast or topology. Methodology of Prediction Example (Weather Prediction) - There is a map of how the weather looks like right now - The blue lines represent the cold fronts, The red lines represent the warm fronts. - In order to make a prediction, what we do is to tighten the mathematical equations for the weather and create a model. - And the trouble is, I can't know precise atmospheric conditions...So I take as much data as possible. -- But then I make small variations in the data and run the model again. --- and again. ---- and again..... -- And what I get is different predictions according to those slight variations. - So hear you can see for the weather tomorrow, the predictions are pretty similar. - We got a lot of blue lines together predicting a cold front, a lot of red line together predicting warm fronts. - But look what happens when I look a little further ahead. -- So Two days, Three days ahead, ... - So you can see that these predictions are beginning to spread out. - You can still see some sort of pattern in the weather. - But know if we look a weak ahead, and now I couldn't even hazard a guess as to what the weather is going to be. -- There are red and blue lines all over the place. - One prediction says its gonna be very hot, the other says it's going to be very cold.  - And if I go ahead 10 days it just looks like a scramble mess of spagetti. There's absolutely know way to make any kind of prediction that far in advance. - And that's why weather beyond just a few days can be so spectacularly wrong. Causality:  - Once we understand the atmosphere is chaotic, we can appreciate that the smallest change in the initial conditions can dramatically alter what will happens. - The movement of just one molecule of air can be magnified overtime to have a huge effect on the weather as a whole. - We sometimes refer to this interfacial phenomena and size effect as the butterfly effect -- The idea that something as small as the flap of a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the atmosphere that could ultimately lead to a tornado or "CYCLONE" on the other side of the world. I AM A CYCLONE AS FROM IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY OF Science and Technology: HOME OF THE CYCLONES - As a crowd, the patterns we make are incredibly predictable; even as individuals, our actions are controlled by the code.  - By untangling chaotic systems like the weather, we've uncovered evidence of the code in what we once thought as of impossibly complex. - When we look at things at a different angle surprising patterns emerge. - Patterns that can reveal defining truths about ourselves and our future. Correlation:  - Now say if we want to tap into the wisdom of the biggest crowd on earth (GOOGLE example) and they have been able to reveal the forces that control our lives and harness to make predictions about us. - Search Query History (over past 3 years), what the patterns of searches for that term look like... - Google had a hunch that they could use all our searches to make predictions of our lives. They wanted to see if they could match the pattern of certain searches with events in the real world. - Google began by seeing if they could predict outbreaks of flu. -- SO flu has a nice seasonal pattern. -- And because it has that pattern every year, over many years, we're able to take taht trend and say, which search queries match that pattern. - So Google built a database that included over 50 million different search terms.
