Well i believe that you can see things in the eyes.
Eyes are the window to the soul
well, eyes are how I express my emotions. I've alwasys drawn them like that. When I was little I was complications that left me deaf for a period (prenatal),
and I couldn't hear so I found myself staring. I relied on people's eyes.

[Yahriel Personal Statement]
Years of dedication to knowledge and a relentless pursuit of excellence have defined my journey. My name is Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, and it translates to "He is free." This freedom, I believe, comes from the boundless possibilities that education and personal growth offer.

As an aerospace engineer researcher with a steadfast commitment to learning, I find myself immersed in a world of limitless exploration. Currently, I am on the path to pursuing a PhD, a voyage that embodies my insatiable hunger for knowledge and my desire to make meaningful contributions to the field.

Having been born in Iowa to undocumented immigrant parents, my upbringing was far from conventional. I faced a unique set of challenges as I navigated a foreign society with no predefined instructions. These early experiences shaped my character and ignited a determination to excel.

Reminiscent of the question surrounding Albert Einstein's genius, I too wondered about the origins of greatness. Just as Einstein's journey was marked by an inquisitive nature, I, Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, shared a passionate and unruly mind. I embarked on an educational odyssey, starting with the Aerospace Engineering program at Iowa State University, and eventually found myself at the California Institute of Technology, where Einstein once roamed.

In the hallowed halls of Caltech, I had the privilege of engaging with some of the world's most powerful minds. It was here that I realized the transformative potential of mentorship and the incredible impact it can have on one's personal and professional development.

Every challenge and emotion I experienced in this new world allowed me to see the collateral beauty of my journey. I discovered that true freedom lies not only in knowledge but also in the ability to share and mentor others on their own paths to greatness. This realization has become a guiding principle in my life, shaping my aspirations and inspiring me to be a beacon of mentorship and knowledge for others.

As Yahriel, I continue to embrace my name's meaning, striving for freedom through the pursuit of knowledge and the cultivation of a supportive community that fosters growth and excellence.

“Madness in individuals is rare — but in groups, it is the rule.”







Message/Call to Action

....
We have to find a way of
engaging in a truthful dialogue

in a language without
knots and entanglements

and the wee, the
wee barbs of hatred

and spite and
revenge and jealousy

and malice and envy that,

that creep into our mouths
and hide in our words.

*OFTEN MISQUOTED & MISINTERPRETED*
MADNESS WAS A SELF HEALING VOYAGE: "to make madness and the process of going mad comprehensible"
A THEORY NOT A FACT
Schizophrenia is defined (neurobiological theory) as a result of abnormal dysfunctions, or abnormal strucutres of the brain.

Schizophrenia cannot be understood without understanding despair

Laing's social explanation of schizophrenia was a result of the interactions between people, especially in families. Bateson er al.(1956) suggested the bind theory, which suggests that children who frequently recieve contradictory messages from their parents are more likely to develop schizophrenia

Existential Perspective: Insanity could be a creative and adaptive response to the world. Ronald David Laing or R.D. developed the theory that mental illness was an escape mechanism that allowed individuals to free themselves from intolerable circumstances.

We are effectively destroying ourselves by violence masquerading as love

Alienation as our present destiny is achieved only by outrageous violence perpetuated by human beings on human beings

We live in a moment of history where change is so speeded up that we begin to see the present only when it is already disapearing.

Insanity - A perfectly rational adjustment to an insane world. 

Freud was a hero. He descended to the Underworld and met there stark terrors. He carried with him his theory as a Medusa's head which turned these terrors to stone

We are all in a post-hypnotic trance induced in early infancy

Children do not give up their innate imagination, curiosity, dreams easily. You have to love them to get them to do that. 

If I don't know I don't know, I think I know. If I don't know I know, I think I don't know. 

Madness need not all be breakdown. It may also be a break-through. It is potential liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and existential death. 

Labels are only a social fact and the social fact of a political event. 

Our family grew up in the "dark ages" of psychiatric treatment and it left its effect on us

"It is not the kind of research that is done very much. It is in-depth, nitty-gritty, personal, small-scale and interpretive." 

"The studies are very interesting but I don't think mainstream psychiatry has understood what to do with them."

the whole philosophy was to discover yourself through losing yourself.

"It took some distance and time for people to sift through what he was saying and see what might be valuable."




Don Quixote Famous Quotes
1. "For neither good nor evil can last for ever; and so it follows that as evil has lasted a long time, good must now be close at hand.”
2. “When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical is madness. To surrender dreams — this may be madness. Too much sanity may be madness — and maddest of all: to see life as it is, and not as it should be!”
3. “Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind.”
4. “Thou hast seen nothing yet.”
5. “Virtue is persecuted by the wicked more than it is loved by the good.”
6. “I do not deny that what happened to us is a thing worth laughing at. But it is not worth telling, for not everyone is sufficiently intelligent to be able to see things from the right point of view.”
7. “It is not the responsibility of knights errant to discover whether the afflicted, the enchained and the oppressed whom they encounter on the road are reduced to these circumstances and suffer this distress for their vices, or for their virtues: the knight's sole responsibility is to succour them as people in need, having eyes only for their sufferings, not for their misdeeds.”
8. “There is no book so bad...that it does not have something good in it.”
9. "I have never died all my life"
10. “Translating from one language to another, unless it is from Greek and Latin, the queens of all languages, is like looking at Flemish tapestries from the wrong side, for although the figures are visible, they are covered by threads that obscure them, and cannot be seen with the smoothness and color of the right side.”
11. “The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks, and it always surfaces above lies, as oil floats on water.”
12. “It is one thing to write as poet and another to write as a historian: the poet can recount or sing about things not as they were, but as they should have been, and the historian must write about them not as they should have been, but as they were, without adding or subtracting anything from the truth.”
13. “What is more dangerous than to become a poet? which is, as some say, an incurable and infectious disease.”
14. “Where there's music there can be no evil.”
15. “Don Quixote is so crazy that he is sure no author could have invented him.”

Title Idea: "How He Got His Scars: The Physicist Explores the Science of Madness and Mental Health in a Psychiatric-Intstitutional Representaion of Schizophrenia and Abnormal Human Ingenuity."
Hook: We live in a moment of history where change is so speeded up that we begin to see the present only when it is already disapearing.
Proposal: To propose that madness may have a function is not to deny the toll it may exact on people, but to help us understand what problem it is meant to solve. 
Background: R.D. Laing theorised that insanity could be understood as a reaction to the divided self. Instead of arising as a purely medical disease, schizophrenia was thus the result of wrestling with two identities: the identity defined for us by our families and our authentic identity, as we experience ourselves to be. When the two are fundamentally different, it triggers an internal fracturing of the self. The psychiatric and scientific world initially and still view Laing's ideas as radical and it took some distance and time for people to sift through what he was saying and see what might be valuable.
An Immenseley Powerful Idea: If I don't know I don't know, I think I know. If I don't know I know, I think I don't know. 
Thesis: Using Ideation of Entropy, or Chaos Theory of Nonlinear Systems, from Thermodynamic Principals to Model Dynamics of Social-Behavioral Systems To Study Schizophrenia and Other Neurological Abnormalities, Morphologies, or Ingenuity of the Human Brain. 
Observation: While deeply institutionalized narratives concerning psychiatrics of mental illness are highly misunderstood, this may be attributed to the fact that R.D. Laing's Development of His Existential Perspective was highly controversial. That is this not the kind that is done very much as it is in-depth, nitty-gritty, personal, small-scale and interpretive."
Intellectual Opportunity: The notion is upheld that Madness need not all be breakdown. It may also be a break-through. It is potential liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and existential death; R.D. argued that Labels associated with Madness are only a social fact and the social fact of a political event. 
Scientific Method: In this study, A Fundamental Method of Studying Neurobiological Abnormal Dysfunctions and/or Abnormal Functions/Morphologies of The Schizophrenic Brain is employed.
Speculation: In order to understand correlations and causality of the active phase-matter in Schizophrenic traits often included in other neurobiological, neurodevelopmental, or psychiatric disorders.
Motivation: The studies are very interesting but mainstream psychiatry nor the global scientific community has understood what to do with the grand discoveries of nuerosciences, global public health, and social sciences.
Objective: The objective is to research and develop a scientific method with scientific instrumentation in order to provide foundational evidence to inform a clinical social explanation of schizophrenia and Schizophrenic-related traits.
Social Impact: This is a signigicant paradigm to be based on biomedical-analytical, logical-mathematical scientific theory to enable elegant delivery of informatics towards advancing Public Global Health.
Message and Call To Action: We have to find a way of engaging in a truthful dialogue; in a language without knots and entanglements; and the wee, the wee barbs of hatred; and spite and revenge and jealousy; and malice and envy that,; that creep into our mouths and hide in our words.
Keywords: Mad-By-Design: An Ancient Paradigm of Psychiatric Thought; Research and Development, History of Indigenous and Latin American Cultures, Anthropology-Engineering, Science and Technology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience Systems, and Social Justice and Global Impact



[ABSTRACT #5]

Synopsis: This new interdisciplinary field captures the essence of the Human Ingenuity, focusing on the exploration of schizophrenia and the idea that madness may serve a function rather than being solely detrimental. The title also highlights the intersection of psychiatric thought, neuroscience, and social justice, emphasizing the potential global impact of this research. By using captivating and thought-provoking language, the scientific story aims to engage readers and spark their curiosity.

Title Idea 1: "Mad-By-Design: Unraveling the Science of Schizophrenia and the Power of Human Ingenuity"
Title Idea 2: "How He Got His Scars: Unraveling Madness to Explore Schizophrenia and Human Ingenuity through a Psychiatric Institution"

Abstract:
In today's rapidly changing world, we often struggle to understand the present before it becomes the past. This proposal aims to shed light on the function of madness, not to undermine its toll on individuals, but to unravel the problem it is meant to solve. Building upon R.D. Laing's revolutionary theory that schizophrenia arises from the battle between our imposed identity and our authentic self, this research explores the possibility of madness as a breakthrough rather than a breakdown. By applying the concepts of entropy and chaos theory to model the dynamics of social-behavioral systems, we aim to study schizophrenia and other neurological abnormalities, morphologies, and ingenuity of the human brain.

Despite the initial controversy surrounding Laing's existential perspective, there is immense value in delving into the personal, interpretive, and small-scale aspects often overlooked in traditional psychiatric narratives. We propose utilizing a fundamental method of studying neurobiological dysfunctions and abnormal functions/morphologies of the schizophrenic brain. This will help uncover correlations and causalities between the active phase-matter in schizophrenic traits and other related disorders.

The motivation behind this study stems from the world's failure to effectively utilize the groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, global public health, and social sciences. Through rigorous research and the development of a scientific method backed by advanced instrumentation, our objective is to provide foundational evidence for a clinical social understanding of schizophrenia and its related traits. This paradigm shift, rooted in biomedical-analytical and logical-mathematical scientific theory, will facilitate the advancement of global public health.

To achieve meaningful impact, we must engage in a truthful dialogue free from knots of hatred, revenge, jealousy, and malice that taint our words. By exploring the history of indigenous and Latin American cultures, anthropology-engineering, science and technology, psychiatry and neuroscience systems, and social justice, we can create an open and inclusive platform for transformative research.

In conclusion, our research proposal "How He Got His Scars" aims to uncover the intricate relationship between madness, mental health, and the human brain. By merging scientific methods with social impact, we can pave the way for advancements in both individual well-being and global public health. It is high time we embrace this ancient paradigm of psychiatric thought, combining research and development with a deep understanding of cultural diversity, to drive positive change in society.
















    [THEME/OBSERVATION] (9/11/23)
    Soon it was realized that these ideas could do much more than simply explain how heat transfer worked.
    Just as Leibniz had suspected with his notion of living force,
        - That these ideas were applicable/capable of a much grander scale
    
    Clausius - Mathematician & Introduced Entropy (2nd Law of Thermodynamics)
    This idea became known as entropy and it turned out to be stranger and more beautiful, 
        more universal than anything that the world could've imagined. 

    [The Collateral Beauty]
    As Boltzmann said, the world is best explored with an open mind
    Not your stereotypical scientist (Boltzmann), more of a temperment associated with a great artist.
        - ruthelessly logical and analytical, yes
            - BUt while working he'd go through periods of intense emotion
                - And these would be followed by terrible depressions.
                    - Which would leave him completely unable to think clearly (or function)

    He had terrible mental crises and breakdowns
        - In which he really thought that the world was coming apart at the seems
    AND YET...
        - These were also accompanied by some of the most profound insights into the nature of our world.

    [WHAT ELSE]
    Outside of mathematics, he was passionate about music
        - and was captivated by the grand _XYZ_ and dramatic _XYZ_ of _XYZ_
            - and the raw emotion of _XYZ_

    Brilliant Musician/WILDCARD
        - Could lose himself for hours in his favorite _XYZ_ 
            - just as he could lose himself in deep mathematical theories.

    [DEVELOPMENT]
    A scientist coordinately guided by emotions and instincts
        - and also by his belief in the ability of mathematics 
            - to unlock the secrets of nature

    It was these TRAITS that would lead him to become one of the champions of a shocking and controversial new theory.
        - One that would describe reality at the very smaller scales,
            - far smaller than anything you could see with a naked eye

    [SPECULATION]
    During the _XYZ_ of the _XYZ_
        - a small group of scientists began speculating that 
            - at the smallest scales (nano-meso scale)
                - the universe might operate very differently to our everyday Experiences
    Universe is made of tiny particles in CONSTANT MOTION

    [AN IMMENSLEY POWERFUL IDEA]
    What is the seemingly insermountable problem with this idea/picture
        - HOW COULD _XYZ_, A ..., EVER BE STUDIED?
        - HOW DO WE DESCRIBE ALL OF THIS?
            - AFTERALL, Rule 1, Rule .., Rule n
                - IT SEEMED ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBLE problem
                    - BECAUSE _XYZ_ saw _XYZ_ more clearly than anyone to explain new strata of reality
                        - IT HAD TO 
    BUT AGAIN, _XYZ_ saw there was a way/path.
        - BECAUSE _XYZ_ saw _XYZ_ more clearly than anyone to explain new strata of reality
            - IT HAD TO ABANDON certainty
    INSTEAD OF, trying to _XYZ_ the exact movements of each individual _XYZ_
        - _XYZ_ saw you could build working theories simply by using the probability of certain vector speed 
    _XYZ_ had TRANSPORTED HIMSELF inside _XYZ_ 
        - He imagined a world beneath our everyday reality
            - And found the mathematics to describe it. 
    IT WOULD BE HERE, AT THIS scale
        - That _XYZ_ would one day manage to unlock energy's deepest secret,
            - Despite the widespread hostility for his theories

    [CAUSALITY/REASONING]
    _XYZ_ ideas were highly, highly controversial
        - you have to remember that today we take ... for granted
    BUT THE REASON we take ... for granted is precisely because of Boltzmann's mathematics
        - beacuse it married up so beautifully with experiment. 
    
    [SUMMARY/DISCUSSION] *GO back and write later*
    One of the 
    - HOSTILE CRITISISM
    - WIDER SCIENTIFIC community
    - PEER REVIEW/Climate
    - POSITION/ARGUMENT
        - Not Observable, so not reality (Therefore Obsolete)
        - Labelled _XYZ_ as a fantasist
            - But Boltzmann was right...
    - REVELATION
        - He peered deeper into reality than anyone else had dared
            - And saw that the universe could be from the _XYZ_ hypothesis
                - AND understoood through the mathematics of probability
                    - The FOUNDATION and CERTAINTY of 19th century science were beginning to crumble.
        - REALIZED 
            - As _XYZ_ stared into his Brave New World of _XYZ_
                - He began to realize that his new vision of the universe...
                    - CONTAINED within it an EXPLANATION
                        - TO one of the Biggest Mysteries in Science
        - EXPLANATION
            - He saw that _XYZ_ could reveal IF the RULE N was/were TRUE/FALSE
                - WHY Nature was engaged in an irreversible process
                    - _XYZ_ had the POWER to reveal what entropy really was
                        - And WHy iT must always INCREASE
            - He understood that these ...,you, me, ... are made of much tiner constituents
                - BASICALLY everything we see is an assembly of trillions and trillions of atoms and molecules
                    - AND THIS WAS THE KEY to his INSIGHT about entropy and _XYZ_

    [CLOSING STATEMENT/CONCLUSION]
    HE/_XYZ_ saw/did/worked what _XYZ_ could not
        - THE REAL REASON why a _XYZ_ under _XYZ_ will always perform _XYZ_
    IMAGINE a _XYZ_ of hot mental

        - System has gone from STATE 1 to STATE 2 (SPECIAL/META)
            - FINDINGS, observations, properties, numerics, logics, etc.
    SIGNIFICANCE
        - His brilliant mind saw this whole process
            - to be then described mathematically
    CONTRIBUTION
        - HIS great contribution was that
            - although we can talk in rather casual terms...
                - about things getting worse as disorder increases.
        - THE great contribution of _XYZ_ is that he could put numbers/science to it
            - and so he was able to derive a formula 
        - WHICH enables you to calculate the disorder of a System
            - (BOLZTMANN's CONSTANT/EQUATION)
        - IT WILL be his enduring contribution to science
            - so much so, it was ... in ...
        - WHAT THIS equation means in essence
            - IS that there are many more ways
                - FOR things to be messy, disordered, chaotic, etc. (EVENT 1)
                - THAN there are for them to be tidy and ordered (EVENT 2)
        - THAT IS WHY .... things always get messier ...
        - CLOSING STATEMENT
            -Things will move from Order to Disorderly
                - IT IS a LAW that APPLIES TO EVERYTHING from a _XYZ_, to a _ZYX_
            - ALL of THIS IS an explanation/expression of the nature's tendency to move from ORder to Disorderly
            - DISORDER IS THE FATE OF EVERYTHING
