{TOPIC/THEME}
"Order and Disorder: The Forces That Drive The Universe"
    - 3 LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS
            - Leibniz (notion of living force)
        - Carnot: Reflections on the motice power of fire
        - Clausius: Mathematician and Entropy/Reversibility
        - Boltzmann: Applied numbers/science to calculate Disorder of System/Assembly

{Storytelling Concept}

   [Cool Facts]
   - Birthday and Synesthesis
   - 2X Iowa Jazz Champion (Trumpet)
        - Given the nickname "Junebug" when I was personally mentored by Jazz Legend Ron Carter in high school
   - I'm not your stereotypical scientist/academic/scholar. 
        - While Ruthelessly logical and analytical, I am a scientist guided by raw emotion and instinct. 
        - Many have said that I possess/express a temperment more associated with a great artist.
        - Because I'm highly, highly creative, illogical, lawless,etc. by nature/default
    - English, Nor Spanish were my first language
    - I am a walking contradiction as I am Orderly and Disorderly



    [THEME/OBSERVATION] (9/11/23)

    Soon it was realized that these ideas could do much more than simply explain how _XYZ_ worked.
    Just as Leibniz had suspected with his notion of living force,
        - That these ideas were applicable/capable of a much grander scale
    
    Clausius - Mathematician & Introduced Entropy (2nd Law of Tth)
    
    This idea became known as _XYZ_ and it turned out to be stranger and more beautiful, 
        more universal than anything that _XYZ_ could've imagined. 


    [The Tax of Being Human or Being Able To Think]
    The world is best explored with an open mind
    Not your stereotypical scientist (Boltzmann), more of a temperment associated with a great artist.
        - ruthelessly logical and analytical, yes
            - BUt while working he'd go through periods of intense emotion
                - And these would be followed by terrible depressions.
                    - Which would leave him completely unable to think clearly (or function)

    [The Collateral Beauty]
    He had terrible mental crises and breakdowns
        - In which he really thought that the world was coming apart at the seems
    AND YET...
        - These were also accompanied by some of the most profound insights into the nature of our world.

    [WHAT ELSE]
    Outside of mathematics, _XYZ_ was passionate about music
        - and was captivated by the grand _XYZ_ and dramatic _XYZ_ of _XYZ_
            - and the raw emotion of _XYZ_

    Brilliant Musician/WILDCARD
        - Could lose himself for hours in his favorite _XYZ_ 
            - just as he could lose himself in deep mathematical theories.

    [DEVELOPMENT]
    A scientist coordinately guided by emotions and instincts
        - and also by his belief in the ability of mathematics 
            - to unlock the secrets of nature

    It was these TRAITS that would lead _XYZ_ to become on eof the champions of a shocking and controversial new theory.
        - One that would describe reality at the very smaller scales,
            - far smaller than anything you could see with a naked eye

    [SPECULATION]
    During the _XYZ_ of the _XYZ_
        - a small group of scientists began speculating that 
            - at the smallest scales (nano-meso scale)
                - the universe might operate very differently to our everyday Experiences
    Universe is made of tiny particles in CONSTANT MOTION

    [AN IMMENSLEY POWERFUL IDEA]
    What is the seemingly insermountable problem with this idea/picture
        - HOW COULD _XYZ_, A ..., EVER BE STUDIED?
        - HOW DO WE DESCRIBE ALL OF THIS?
            - AFTERALL, Rule 1, Rule .., Rule n
                - IT SEEMED ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBLE problem
                    - BECAUSE _XYZ_ saw _XYZ_ more clearly than anyone to explain new strata of reality
                        - IT HAD TO 
    BUT AGAIN, _XYZ_ saw there was a way/path.
        - BECAUSE _XYZ_ saw _XYZ_ more clearly than anyone to explain new strata of reality
            - IT HAD TO ABANDON certainty
    INSTEAD OF, trying to _XYZ_ the exact movements of each individual _XYZ_
        - _XYZ_ saw you could build working theories simply by using the probability of certain vector speed 
    _XYZ_ had TRANSPORTED HIMSELF inside _XYZ_ 
        - He imagined a world beneath our everyday reality
            - And found the mathematics to describe it. 
    IT WOULD BE HERE, AT THIS scale
        - That _XYZ_ would one day manage to unlock energy's deepest secret,
            - Despite the widespread hostility for his theories

    [CAUSALITY/REASONING]
    _XYZ_ ideas were highly, highly controversial
        - you have to remember that today we take ... for granted
    BUT THE REASON we take ... for granted is precisely because of Boltzmann's mathematics
        - beacuse it married up so beautifully with experiment. 
    
    [SUMMARY/DISCUSSION] *GO back and write later*
    One of the 
    - HOSTILE CRITISISM
    - WIDER SCIENTIFIC community
    - PEER REVIEW/Climate
    - POSITION/ARGUMENT
        - Not Observable, so not reality (Therefore Obsolete)
        - Labelled _XYZ_ as a fantasist
            - But Boltzmann was right...
    - REVELATION
        - He peered deeper into reality than anyone else had dared
            - And saw that the universe could be from the _XYZ_ hypothesis
                - AND understoood through the mathematics of probability
                    - The FOUNDATION and CERTAINTY of 19th century science were beginning to crumble.
        - REALIZED 
            - As _XYZ_ stared into his Brave New World of _XYZ_
                - He began to realize that his new vision of the universe...
                    - CONTAINED within it an EXPLANATION
                        - TO one of the Biggest Mysteries in Science
        - EXPLANATION
            - He saw that _XYZ_ could reveal IF the RULE N was/were TRUE/FALSE
                - WHY Nature was engaged in an irreversible process
                    - _XYZ_ had the POWER to reveal what entropy really was
                        - And WHy iT must always INCREASE
            - He understood that these ...,you, me, ... are made of much tiner constituents
                - BASICALLY everything we see is an assembly of trillions and trillions of atoms and molecules
                    - AND THIS WAS THE KEY to his INSIGHT about entropy and _XYZ_

    [CLOSING STATEMENT/CONCLUSION]
    HE/_XYZ_ saw/did/worked what _XYZ_ could not
        - THE REAL REASON why a _XYZ_ under _XYZ_ will always perform _XYZ_
    IMAGINE a _XYZ_ of hot mental
        - THE _XYZ_ inside are jostling around
    ENERGY TRANSPORT AT INTERFACE
        - Theory and Model and Hypothesis of NATURAL PROCESS
    OUTOMCE
        - System has gone from STATE 1 to STATE 2 (SPECIAL/META)
            - FINDINGS, observations, properties, numerics, logics, etc.
    SIGNIFICANCE
        - His brilliant mind saw this whole process
            - to be then described mathematically
    CONTRIBUTION
        - HIS great contribution was that
            - although we can talk in rather casual terms...
                - about things getting worse as disorder increases.
        - THE great contribution of _XYZ_ is that he could put numbers/science to it
            - and so he was able to derive a formula 
        - WHICH enables you to calculate the disorder of a System
            - (BOLZTMANN's CONSTANT/EQUATION)
        - IT WILL be his enduring contribution to science
            - so much so, it was ... in ...
        - WHAT THIS equation means in essence
            - IS that there are many more ways
                - FOR things to be messy, disordered, chaotic, etc. (EVENT 1)
                - THAN there are for them to be tidy and ordered (EVENT 2)
        - THAT IS WHY .... things always get messier ...
        - CLOSING STATEMENT
            -Things will move from Order to Disorderly
                - IT IS a LAW that APPLIES TO EVERYTHING from a _XYZ_, to a _ZYX_
            - ALL of THIS IS an explanation/expression of the nature's tendency to move from ORder to Disorderly
            - DISORDER IS THE FATE OF EVERYTHING
