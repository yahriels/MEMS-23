# Paper-based MEMS Devices Project
Abstract:  In an era where electronic devices are becoming rapidly more complex and expensive. High efficiency (i.e. performance/cost ratio) in devices becomes harder to achieve as fabrication costs escalate as the assemblies of elegant high-performance devices require more sophisticated material systems. Conceptually, however, devices such as piezo transducers simply create connections between mechanical stimuli and electrical resistance changes, which, can be achieved through simple, well-designed device architectures. Piezoelectric and piezoresistive micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensor devices are examples of elegant, simple, efficient architectures that can be utilized to create various, more complex devices using a plethora of material selections. Here, we use material that is abundant, green and low-cost such as paper for a platform to build these devices. Utilizing the fundamentals of piezoresistive effects, paper-based devices can proof to be a highly efficient and facile option for electronic devices. Frugal science/innovation, the ability to minimize cost and complexity while providing efficient solutions to better human conditions is a central theme herein. Furthermore, the deformability of papers leads to easier access to wider, more unique form factors, without increasing the cost of fabrication significantly, leading to simple assemblies of 2- or 3- dimensional, multi-functional devices.
